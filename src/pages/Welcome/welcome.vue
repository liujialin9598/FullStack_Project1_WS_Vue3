        This website is designed to simulate the lifetime well-being of members
        in retirement.
      </p>

      <h2><a href="/sone">In Simulation 1 :</a></h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The representative member has their superannuation (pension fund)
          invested in the standard product.
        </li>
        <li>
          The representative member is single female, 67 years, with a balance
          of $300k.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2><a href="/stwo">In Simulation 2 :</a></h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Everything in the model is the same as Simulation 1, except for the
          following:
        </li>
        <li>
          The return on the members balance each year, rt, is now inflation + 1%
          guaranteed by the superannuation fund.
        </li>
        <li>
          That is, Simulation 2 is the same as Simulation 1 except that return
          is now not its own draw from a normal distribution, but instead
          <code>rt = Inft + 0.01</code>.
